# A Speed Detector Program

# It is designed to detect and evaluate the speed of a  car.
# It takes the speed of a car as input and checks if it is within the legal speed limit (70 km/h). 
# If the speed exceeds this limit, it calculates demerit points for every 5 km/h above the speed limit. 
# If the demerit points exceed 12, the program outputs that the driver's license is suspended.
